# Counts the number of times each element occurs in a list

This project implements the same frequency counter a number of times,
trying to systematically increase the parallelism of the program with each implementation.

It tries to implement parallel techniques from chapter 2 and 3 in
[Simon Marlow's book](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/index.html).

The frequency counter accepts a text file as input from the command-line, and then prints the frequency
that each character occurs.

## Sample Text Files

[Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) by Edwin A. Abbott is a small text and included in this repository.

I mostly ran my programs against [the longest book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_novels) I could find:
A French novel called [ArtamÃ¨ne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artam%C3%A8ne).

You can download it with the following command:
```
curl http://www.artamene.org/documents/cyrus[1-10].txt | iconv --from-code=ISO-8859-1 --to-code=UTF8 > artamene.txt
```

## Results so far

I've managed to get more than twice the speed in my fastest parallel implementation.
But looking at the threadscope images, it does seem that there are still significant portions that
does not run in parallel.

[Claude Heiland-Allen](http://mathr.co.uk/blog/) was kind enough to implement this problem,
along with detailed explanations of how he achieved better performance.

Thanks Claude!

I have been improving some of my code based on his:

## Running the command-line executables

You can run all of these with summarised output by using the following script:
```
$ ./summary.sh flatland.txt

## Building

Needed only once after cloning the repo:

```bash
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal update
```

Compile and install after each code change:

```bash
$ cabal install -j
```

## Threadscope

All of the executables are compiled with *-eventlog* and run using *+RTS -ls*, and should therefore
produce eventlog output files that can be inspected using threadscope.
