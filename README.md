# Counts the number of times each element occurs in a list

This project implements the same frequency counter a number of times,
trying to systematically increase the parallelism of the program with each implementation.

It tries to implement parallel techniques from chapter 2 and 3 in
[Simon Marlow's book](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929/index.html).

The frequency counter accepts a text file as input from the command-line, and then prints the frequency
that each character occurs.

[Claude Heiland-Allen](http://mathr.co.uk/blog/) was kind enough to implement this problem,
along with detailed explanations of how he achieved better performance.

Thanks Claude!

I have been improving a lot of my code based on his implementation:

## Sample Text Files

[Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) by Edwin A. Abbott is a small text and included in this repository.

I mostly ran my programs against [the longest book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_novels) I could find:
A French novel called [ArtamÃ¨ne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artam%C3%A8ne).

You can download it with the following command:

## Benchmarks

The following benchmarks have been run on a 2012 Macbook Pro with 8 cores.

```
$ ./summary.sh artamene.txt
f1-seq-datalist.sh: Sequential. Frequency implementation based on list grouping/sorting.
            1192 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)
  Total   time   26.600s  ( 27.285s elapsed)

f2-seq-datamap.sh: Sequential. Frequency implementation based on Map.fromListWith
               2 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)
  Total   time    2.056s  (  2.096s elapsed)

f3-par-divide-conquer.sh: Parallel. Split list in half recursively, with each half being run in parallel.
             645 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)
  Parallel GC work balance: 0.90% (serial 0%, perfect 100%)
  TASKS: 6 (1 bound, 5 peak workers (5 total), using -N2)
  SPARKS: 4 (2 converted, 0 overflowed, 0 dud, 0 GC'd, 2 fizzled)
  Total   time    5.194s  (  3.350s elapsed)

f4-seq-chunked.sh: Sequential. Split file into chunks so we can parallelise the chunks later.
f4-seq-chunked.sh: Speedup mostly due to using Data.ByteString and Data.Text for chunking instead of lists.
              19 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)
  Total   time    2.645s  (  2.713s elapsed)

f5-par-parmap.sh: Parallel. Use parMap which creates a spark for each list element.
              26 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)
  Parallel GC work balance: 32.12% (serial 0%, perfect 100%)
  TASKS: 10 (1 bound, 9 peak workers (9 total), using -N4)
  SPARKS: 5 (4 converted, 0 overflowed, 0 dud, 0 GC'd, 1 fizzled)
  Total   time    3.518s  (  0.977s elapsed)

f6-par-using-strategy.sh: Parallel. Use the parList strategy instead of a custom parMap.
              25 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)
  Parallel GC work balance: 70.26% (serial 0%, perfect 100%)
  TASKS: 10 (1 bound, 9 peak workers (9 total), using -N4)
  SPARKS: 10 (8 converted, 0 overflowed, 0 dud, 1 GC'd, 1 fizzled)
  Total   time    3.294s  (  0.905s elapsed)
```

## Building

Needed only once after cloning the repo:

```bash
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal update
```

Compile and install after each code change:

```bash
$ cabal install -j
```

## Threadscope

All of the executables are compiled with *-eventlog* and run using *+RTS -ls*, and should therefore
produce eventlog output files that can be inspected using threadscope.
